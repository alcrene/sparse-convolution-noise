# Generate colored noise with sparse convolutions

The sparse convolution algorithm is an effective way to generate a noise signal, which can among other things then be used to simulate noisy inputs. The original presentation by Lewis [(1989)](https://doi.org/doi:10.1145/74333.74360), as well as most subsequent implementations, focus on applications to computer graphics. Here the implementation is geared more towards scientific applications; in this context we find the sparse convolution algorithm convenient for a number of reasons:
- The returned noise function is *dense* (or *solid*): it can be evaluated at any *t*.
- The algorithm allows quite a lot of control over the statistics of the noise, and in particular of its autocorrelation function.
- The algorithm does not rely on performing FFTs, and thus avoids all the pitfalls those entail.
  It is also faster to evaluate, and does not struggle with long time traces.

For more information on how this works, see the [doc page](https://alcrene.github.io/colored-noise).

## Design goals & usage

In applications, often we characterize signals by their autocorrelation function; when we want to characterize them by a single number, that number is generally the *correlation time*, describing the width the of autocorrelation function. Computing the autocorrelation function for a given stochastic system is often a difficult analytical problem. Therefore, an algorithm which promises to solve the *inverse* problem – going from autocorrelation function to a noise – is a valuable tool in the practitioner’s toolkit. This is what the sparse convolution algorithm purports to offer.

This particular implementation focuses on the case where a user desires to generate noise with a particular correlation time. At present only a single class is provided, which generates noise signals with Gaussian autocorrelation. In use one simply specifies the desired time range, correlation time and noise strength:

```python
from colored_noise import ColoredNoise

noise = ColoredNoise(0, 10, scale=2.4, corr_time=1.2)
```

Then one simply evaluates the noise at any time `t`:

```python
noise(t)
```

Specifying values with `pint` units are supported, which can be an effective way to sanity-check your calculations.

Conveniently, because the produced noise is dense, it can even be used in integration schemes like adaptive Runge-Kutta, where the required time points are not known ahead of time.

The `noise` object has a few convenience methods, most notably `autocorr` which evaluates the theoretical autocorrelation.

## Installation

- **Direct copy**
  Everything is contained in the file *colored_noise.py* – about 150 lines of code and 400 lines of documentation & validation. So a very reasonably option is actually to just copy the file into your project and import it as any other module.

- **As a subrepo**
  A more sophisticated option is to clone this repo directly into your project with [git-subrepo](https://github.com/ingydotnet/git-subrepo):

  ```bash
  git subrepo clone https://github.com/alcrene/colored-noise my-project/colored-noise`
  ```

  This creates a directory under *my-project/colored-noise* containing the files in this repo – effectively *colored-noise* becomes a subpackage of your own. You can then import the noise class as with any subpackage:
  
  ```python
  from colored_noise import ColoredNoise
  ```

  or
  
  ```python
  from my_project.colored_noise import ColoredNoise
  ```

  The main advantage of a subrepo installation is that it makes it easy to pull code updates:

  ```bash
  git subrepo pull my-project/colored-noise
  ```

  It also makes it easier to open pull requests.

- **No pip package ?**
  Although very simple, this code has not yet been widely used. Therefore I like the fact that by installing the source directly, users are encouraged to take more ownership of the code, and perhaps have a peek if things don’t work exactly as they expect. (Compared to the turn-key usage suggested by a pip install.)

  Having users add this directly to their source code also makes it easier for me to push patches to them if they discover issues, and it simplifies the dependencies for *their* users (since the source is packaged along with their project, there is no dependency on this repo).

  All that said, if there is interest, I can certainly put this on PyPI.


## Dependencies

The only dependencies are [NumPy](https://numpy.org) and [SciPy](https://scipy.org). If you want to build the docs yourself, they you also need:

- [holoviews](https://holoviews.org/)
- [pint](https://pint.readthedocs.io)
- [jupytext]()
- [jupyter-book](https://jupyterbook.org)
- [ghp-import](https://github.com/davisp/ghp-import)  (optional)

## Building the documentation

First make sure that the above dependencies are installed, and then that Jupyter Notebook version of the code file *colored_noise* exists. The easiest way to do this is usually to open it in the Jupyter Lab interface with "Open as notebook". Alternatively, you can run `jupytext --sync colored_noise.py`.
The actual build command is then

```bash
jb build colored_noise.ipynb
```

This will produce some HTML files inside a *_build* folder. For this package we build the docs in a separate `gh-pages` branch, so that users can pull the source without pulling the docs. This is done automatically by `ghp-import`:

```bash
ghp-import -n -p _build/_page/colored_noise/html
```

See the [Jupyter Book docs](https://jupyterbook.org/en/stable/basics/building/index.html) for more information.
